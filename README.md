# Portfolio Website

## Initial porfolio website with experience and projects

### Includes the following:
- About me section describing work history
- Experience with various programming languages
- Links to other sample projects
- Contact form

### The site is in progress and will continue to be updated.

The goal of building the site was to get more practice with
html, css, javascript, and github while creating a foundation
for a hub to display all future projects.
